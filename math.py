Lucky numbers are defined via a sieve as follows.
Begin with a list of integers starting with 1 :
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, . . . .
Now eliminate every second number :
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, ...
The second remaining number is 3, so remove every 3rd number:
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, 21, 25, ...
The next remaining number is 7, so remove every 7th number:
1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, ...
Next, remove every 9th number and so on.
Finally, the resulting sequence is the lucky numbers.

18. Write a Python program to computing square roots using the Babylonian method. Go to the editor
Perhaps the first algorithm used for approximating √S is known as the Babylonian method, named after the Babylonians, or "Hero's method", named after the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method. It can be derived from (but predates by 16 centuries) Newton's method. The basic idea is that if x is an overestimate to the square root of a non-negative real number S then S / x will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers may reasonably be expected to provide a better approximation.

20. Write a Python program to calculate magic square. Go to the editor
A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers (i.e., each number is used once), usually integers, in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the main and secondary diagonals, all add up to the same number, called the "magic constant." A magic square has the same number of rows as it has columns, and in conventional math notation, "n" stands for the number of rows (and columns) it has. Thus, a magic square always contains n2 numbers, and its size (the number of rows [and columns] it has) is described as being "of order n".
